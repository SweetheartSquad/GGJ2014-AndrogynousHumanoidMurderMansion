Part Turing Game, part kuso-ge, part duel simulator, part art game, part rejection of art game. Percentages to be determined by each individual as they see fit. 

AHMM is a two-player competitive game. The goal is to figure out through context which of the hundreds of similar-looking onscreen characters is you, and to keep your identity a secret from your opponent while you attempt to reveal theirs and murder them.

Featuring randomly generated characters, levels, and music; 3 types of enemy AI; and an "aggression map" that tracks acts of violence and augments the homicidal tendency of nearby witnesses.

Developed in openFL with the HaxeFlixel library.
